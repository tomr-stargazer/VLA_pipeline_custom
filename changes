EVLA_pipeline.py
-updated casa version number, pipeline version number, revision date
-In the past the internal CASA version (through the command casadef.casa_version) was e.g. '4.6.0',
now it is '4.7.0-REL (r38335)'. Formatted the CASA version check syntax to accommodate this change.


EVLA_pipe_fluxboot.py
EVLA_pipe_plotsummary.py
EVLA_pipe_semiFinalBPdcals1.py
EVLA_pipe_semiFinalBPdcals2.py
EVLA_pipe_testBPdcals.py
The above noted scripts use plotms with time averaging. In the past the unit 's' was included in the
syntax of the parameter avgtime, e.g., avgtime='1e8s'. In CASA 4.7.0 the unit should be removed, i.e.,
avgtime='1e8'. Changes have been made to reflect this.


EVLA_pipe_msinfo.py
Added several more baselines in the plotms call to plot elevation vs. time in case the two that were
being used had issues.


EVLA_pipe_calprep.py
EVLA_pipe_fluxgains.py
EVLA_pipe_finalcals.py
In these scripts in the setjy execution on the FDSC and while looping on the spw's, if a given spw is
flagged the script is quitting in CASA 4.7.0. Added try/except statements so that the pipeline
execution continues.


EVLA_pipe_plotsummary.py
Added amplitude vs. frequency plots per field per baseband +  phase vs. frequency plots per field per
baseband. Set it up so that for new data it should plot per field and per band and per baseband and will
exclude the ref pointing setups. For old data it should plot all the spw's per field.


EVLA_pipe_weblog.py
-Because of the change in the internal definition of casadef.casa_version, updated this script so that
the weblog does not show redundant revision information.
-Added the lines to include the Amp & Phase vs. Freq plots in the weblog.
